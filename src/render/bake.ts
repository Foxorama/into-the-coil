/**
 * Baking — every sprite drawn once, at load, into an offscreen bitmap.
 *
 * `docs/decisions/0022-frame-rate-is-a-feature.md`: art is a pure function of
 * `(kind, variant, palette, view)`, drawn once and blitted thereafter. Per-frame path filling is
 * banned. This is both halves of the procedural-versus-sprites argument at once — no asset files, so
 * `docs/decisions/0003-single-file-build.md` survives; a blit per entity, so the frame cost is a
 * sprite's; and the art is still a function of the palette, which is what makes 0024's high-contrast
 * and colour-blind palettes a re-bake rather than a second art pass.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The shapes here are placeholders. The pipeline is not.** `view` is a real argument and the
 * seam it opens is real — `docs/game.md` calls two views per entity the single largest art cost in
 * the project. What is temporary is that these particular shapes are rotations of one another; a
 * real side profile and a real top-down are different drawings, and the day they arrive nothing
 * outside this file changes.
 *
 * ⚠️ **This file is NOT on the hot list, and must never be called from a frame.** It allocates
 * freely, because it runs at load and on rotation. `src/app/frame.ts` is the file that runs every
 * frame, and it cannot reach this.

    THE HURT SILHOUETTES: the SAME shape in a different ink.

    Same shape is what makes it read as *that thing being hurt* rather than as a second object
    appearing where the first one was. And the ink is the only channel doing colour work here, which
    is allowed precisely because the silhouette is unchanged — 0024's rule is that colour may not
    carry meaning ALONE, and here the shape carries identity while the colour carries the event.

    ⚠️ **THE SHIP IS YELLOW AND AN ENEMY IS WHITE, and they are different on purpose.** The ship
    briefly went white too, when the flash was generalised from the ship to everything, and a
    play-test asked for the yellow back. It is the better answer for a reason worth writing down: the
    ship's blink means *you cannot be hurt right now* and an enemy's flash means *this just was*, and
    those are opposite meanings. One ink for both is one channel carrying two things, which is the
    failure `docs/decisions/0024-the-accessibility-floor-is-settings.md` exists to prevent.

    ⚠️ `hazard` is borrowed rather than owned, and it will want revisiting when environmental hazards
    land — an asteroid and a recovering ship would then share a colour. They would not share a
    silhouette, so it is a note rather than a defect, and inventing a `warn` role for content that
    does not exist yet is the shape of mistake this project has already made once with the ship
    roster. `docs/decisions/0035-damage-is-legible-on-the-body-that-took-it.md`.
